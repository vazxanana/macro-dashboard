# macro-dashboard — working notes

Single-file gold trading platform: everything lives in `gold-trading.html`
(HTML + CSS + JS inline). Deployed to GitHub Pages via
`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` on every push to `main`.

## Locked features — do NOT remove or replace in redesigns

- **Market structure engine** (`structureMap` + `makeStructPrimitive` +
  `renderStructReadout`): major-structure mapping on the Multi-Timeframe
  charts — `bos` only at the ratcheting trend extreme, `ChoCh` only at the
  protected origin swing, dashed gray `idm` inducement marks, dashed amber
  liquidity `sweep` marks, and the plain-language structure readout under
  each chart. The owner explicitly asked to keep this. Display preference
  (also owner-requested): all MTF charts hide the HH/HL/LH/LL swing tags
  and the "bos" label text (`structOpts: { hideTags, hideBosLabel }`);
  break lines still draw and ChoCh stays labelled.
- **Supply/demand order-block zones** (`sdZones` via `structureMap(...).zones`):
  green demand / red supply boxes at break-leg origins on the MTF charts
  (ChoCh origins drawn brighter), live until a body close through the far
  side. These replaced the engulfing zones on the MTF tab — do not bring
  the engulfing zones back there. The EG desk charts keep their own
  engulfing zones (that is the strategy being traded there).

## Macro driver stack

15 weighted drivers feed `computeDailyBias()` (real yields, macro composite,
daily structure, S/D block location, VIX, real-yield momentum, breakeven,
2Y, DXY momentum, COT, yield curve, HY spreads, Dollar Smile regime,
Eurozone growth pulse, Yen carry-unwind risk). The last three are mined
from an institutional macro handbook the owner supplied (Dollar Smile
theory, global dollar liquidity, Germany/Eurozone, Japan) — see
`dollarSmileRegime()`, and the `fundX.euGrowth` / `fundX.jpyMom` / `fundX.sofr`
fetches in `refreshFundamentalsX()`. The Yen carry-unwind row is
deliberately always `dir: null` (a volatility warning, not a directional
call) — don't "fix" it to always vote a direction.

## Conventions

- Any change to `gold-trading.html` should keep the file self-contained
  (no build step, no external JS beyond the Lightweight Charts CDN and
  keyless public data APIs).
- Test headlessly with Playwright before deploying; verify the Pages
  deploy run goes green after merging.
