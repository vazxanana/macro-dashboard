# macro-dashboard — working notes

Single-file gold trading platform: everything lives in `gold-trading.html`
(HTML + CSS + JS inline). Deployed to GitHub Pages via
`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` on every push to `main`.

## Locked features — do NOT remove or replace in redesigns

- **Market structure engine** (`structureMap` + `makeStructPrimitive` +
  `renderStructReadout`): major-structure mapping on the Multi-Timeframe
  charts — `bos` only at the ratcheting trend extreme, `ChoCh` only at the
  protected origin swing, dashed gray `idm` inducement marks, dashed amber
  liquidity `sweep` marks, and the plain-language structure readout under
  each chart. The owner explicitly asked to keep this. Display preference
  (also owner-requested): all MTF charts hide the HH/HL/LH/LL swing tags
  and the "bos" label text (`structOpts: { hideTags, hideBosLabel }`);
  break lines still draw and ChoCh stays labelled.
- **Supply/demand order-block zones** (`sdZones` via `structureMap(...).zones`):
  green demand / red supply boxes at break-leg origins on the MTF charts
  (ChoCh origins drawn brighter), live until a body close through the far
  side. These replaced the engulfing zones on the MTF tab — do not bring
  the engulfing zones back there. The EG desk charts keep their own
  engulfing zones (that is the strategy being traded there).

## Macro driver stack

15 weighted drivers feed `computeDailyBias()` (real yields, macro composite,
daily structure, S/D block location, VIX, real-yield momentum, breakeven,
2Y, DXY momentum, COT, yield curve, HY spreads, Dollar Smile regime,
Eurozone growth pulse, Yen carry-unwind risk). The last three are mined
from an institutional macro handbook the owner supplied (Dollar Smile
theory, global dollar liquidity, Germany/Eurozone, Japan) — see
`dollarSmileRegime()`, and the `fundX.euGrowth` / `fundX.jpyMom` / `fundX.sofr`
fetches in `refreshFundamentalsX()`. The Yen carry-unwind row is
deliberately always `dir: null` (a volatility warning, not a directional
call) — don't "fix" it to always vote a direction.

## Conventions

- Any change to `gold-trading.html` should keep the file self-contained
  (no build step, no external JS beyond the Lightweight Charts CDN and
  keyless public data APIs).
- Test headlessly with Playwright before deploying; verify the Pages
  deploy run goes green after merging.

## Public / admin split (6 Nov 2026, owner request)

`market-structure.html` has two modes: **public** (default) shows only trades (market, side, entry, stop, target, result)
and the chart markups; **admin** (footer "Admin login", SHA-256 of the password compared with `MS_ADMIN_HASH` in the head
script, token kept in localStorage `ms-admin`) shows everything (Setup, Scanner, system cards, shadow trades, scorecards,
reviews, notes). Anything that describes a rule, a system name, a note or a reason must sit inside an element with class
`adm`, or be guarded by `PUB` in the JS templates; `pubonly` is the public-only counterpart. Keep it that way in redesigns.
To change the password: compute `sha256` of the new one (e.g. `printf %s 'new' | sha256sum`) and replace both copies of the hash.

### Accounts and sign-in (6 Nov 2026)

The page opens on a centred sign-in card (`#ms-gate`, shown while `html[data-gate]`) unless the visitor is signed in or
chose **Continue as guest** (localStorage `ms-guest`, public view). Sign-in is password only (6 Nov): the password picks the account (owner = `MS_ADMIN_HASH`, others matched against
`MS_USERS` hashes), so every password must be unique.
Reviewers live in `window.MS_USERS` (head script: `{ <username>: { name, hash: sha256(password), role: 'reviewer' } }`;
currently **Fred**); a reviewer session stores `ms-admin` = their hash and `ms-user` = the user name, gets the admin view
read-only (`html[data-role="reviewer"] .own` hides the owner's journal, log-trade button, CSV loader and Telegram
settings) and can write loss reviews, which carry `by: <name>`. The footer is hidden; log in / log out live in the account menu (`#ms-me`), which clicks the hidden `#ms-admin-link`. To add a reviewer, add an entry with the SHA-256 of their password.
Viewers (`role: 'viewer'`, currently **Orlando**, **Luxus** and **Carlos**; `VIEWER` in the main script) are read-only with a reduced site: Home
(Today strip, open positions, setup now), Setup, and the Council overview (active trades + P&L calendar); no charts,
scanner, journal, other council panes, loss-review panel, alerts, settings, or photo/name changes.
Guests (owner, 6 Nov) see only `#v-guest`: an H4 gold chart (`renderGuest()`) with one system trade (the open/pending
gold system trade, else the latest closed) drawn as an entry line, a stop zone and a target zone, no labels; all other
views, the nav, the header badge, alerts and settings are hidden for `html[data-role="public"]`. Guests also see the results of
our main system only (`sysClosed()`: live system trades, the system's replay and NQ forward paper; never shadow): the
Today / week / month strip (`#g-today`, `renderToday()` with system-only numbers and live floating) and a P&L calendar
(`#g-cal`, `renderGuestCal()`).

Header (6 Nov): Settings and Alerts are icon buttons; the account area `#ms-me` (oval photo, time-of-day greeting,
name) opens a menu to change photo (resized, stored per user in localStorage `ms-photo-<user>`), display name
(`ms-name-<user>`) and log in/out. Default portrait: a gold monogram for named users, a silhouette for guests. The sign-in page is
branded "Aurum Desk" with a gold chart background (no system names on it).

## Loss review (6 Nov 2026, owner request)

Admin-only card `#ms-loss` on `market-structure.html`: every losing trade (live and shadow, 7 or 30 days) stacked by the
strategy that took it; a row opens the trade chart, where `#ms-tv-rv` adds drawing (pen, line, text; points stored as
[UTC time, price]), reason tags, a "why it failed" note and a rule idea. Reviews are kept in localStorage `msLossRev` and,
when the owner pastes a GitHub fine-grained token (localStorage `msGhTok`, Contents read/write on this repo), written to
`council-data/reviews/losses.json`. The trader reads that file: tags hunt / noise / late / news count in its lesson
rules; other tags repeating 3+ times on a setup become `snapshot.ownerReviews.candidates`, which the twice-daily council
check tests before any rule change and answers in each review's `council: {at, verdict, note}`.
The trade dialog has a timeframe row (`#ms-tv-tf`: Auto, M1–D1) and "More history" (+300 candles back each tap, up to
~3,800); candles come from the trade's own dates (`rangeBars`: Binance pages, Bitstamp for forex, latest candles as a
fallback). A timeframe switch keeps the review being written (`openTrade(id, keep)` skips `rvOpen`).

## Council layout (6 Nov 2026 renovation)

The Council view is a workspace with a sticky section bar (`#ms-c-nav`, tab pattern, arrow keys) and five panes
(`#ms-cp-<name>`): **overview** (active trades + calendar), **trades** (Trader table), **systems** (`adm`: NQ, gold
replica, pairs; their static rule texts fold into `<details class="c-how">`), **review** (`adm`: loss review + trade
reviews; the tab badge counts losses of the last 24 h not reviewed yet) and **research** (`adm`: analyst, coach, scorecard,
backtest). Deep links `#council/<name>`; the last pane is remembered (localStorage `msCpane`); public mode only sees
overview and trades. The trade chart dialog `#ms-tv` lives at the end of the app container, not inside a card, so it opens
from any pane. Card titles (`.ms-k`) are sentence-case headings, not uppercase eyebrows. New council cards go into the
pane they belong to, not into one long grid.

## Home and navigation (6 Nov 2026, renovation 2)

Home is a dashboard: quick-jump row (`.h-quick`), a "Today" strip (`#h-today`, `renderToday()`: floating now from
`window.FLOAT` set in `renderActive()`, closed R today / this week / this month from `COUNCIL.trades`, live + shadow with
the live part shown), then two columns: Setup now (admin) + Open positions (`#h-act-list`, biggest market+side groups,
rows open the trade chart) on the left, compact tiles (`.tile-s`) on the right. The bottom tab bar (`.btab`, now with
Scanner for admin) becomes a fixed left sidebar at ≥1180 px, where the header's top tabs are hidden.

## Users page (6 Nov 2026)

Owner-only view `#users` (sidebar "Users"): lists the built-in accounts (`MS_USERS` in the head script) and the ones
added or changed on the page, which live in `council-data/users.json` (`{ users: { key: { name, hash, role, disabled? } } }`,
written with the owner's GitHub token, `msGhTok`). users.json overrides built-ins (`msMergeUsers`); `disabled: true`
removes one. Sign-in fetches the list; a signed-in non-owner is re-checked after load and signed out if removed or if the
password changed (`ms-user-rec` keeps an added user's record between visits). Passwords must stay unique per account.

## ICT desk (6 Nov 2026, owner: a separate edge)

ICT is its own edge and approach: never mix it into the council systems, their rules, filters or reports.
Rules and research live in `.claude/skills/ICT/SKILL.md` (results also in council-data `research/ict/`).
- Tracker: `ict/tracker.mjs`, workflow `.github/workflows/ict.yml` (every 15 min), data in council-data `ict/`
  (`trades.json`, `snapshot.json`, `bars.json`). Markets: NQ, ES, YM, RTY futures from CNBC (Yahoo fallback). Model: H1 iFVG
  reversal (swing swept → body closes through the leg's FVG within 6 H1 candles; stop 2 ticks beyond the sweep;
  3R target, 2R mark recorded as `R2`; 48 h max). Every signal records ICT features (`feat`) and a /10 grade.
- Page: view `#ict` ("ICT desk", class `ictx`), shown only when `html[data-ict]` is set: the owner, and users
  with `ict: true` (Fred, the main reviewer and trader, lands there after sign-in). The desk user marks signals
  Taken / Skipped / Missed with fill and own R, grades them and writes notes: localStorage `ictDesk`, synced to
  council-data `ict/desk.json` with the `msGhTok` token.
- Read-only desk: `ict: 'read'` on a user (Orlando) sets `html[data-ict-ro]`, which hides `.ict-rw` (the review form,
  "My trading", GitHub saving); viewers with ICT access may open `#ict`.
- Replay: `ict/replay.mjs` (workflow `ict-replay.yml`: on change, on demand with a start date, weekly) runs the same
  `signals()` over CNBC history since 1 Apr 2026 and writes council-data `ict/replay.json` (records carry `replay: true`).
  The desk has a Both / Live / Replay switch (localStorage `ictSrc`) and a P&L calendar of closed signals.
