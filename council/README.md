# Mosha council

Three roles work the Mosha market-structure setups:

| Role | Runs | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Analyst** | Claude, Mondays | Reads the week's snapshot of every market and writes `analysis/latest.md`: bias per market, key levels, which setups are likely, news to watch. |
| **Trader** | GitHub Actions, every 14–15 min, 24/7 (`.github/workflows/council.yml` loops and restarts itself) | Runs `council/trader.mjs`: the same engine as the page (`council/engine.mjs`), paper-trades every Ready setup (max 2 live trades per market, never long and short together), manages fills, stops and targets, writes `trades.json` and `snapshot.json`. |
| **Coach** | Statistics daily in the trader job, plus a Claude daily review | Pauses losing setups, tunes the stop buffer and minimum reward:risk inside fixed limits, logs every change in `config.json` → `history`, and writes `reviews/latest.md`. |

All results live on the `council-data` branch. Limits the Coach may change on its own:
break-even at +1R on/off, stop buffer 0.10–0.25 × ATR, minimum stop distance 0.4–1.2 × ATR, minimum reward:risk 1.2–2.5, pause a setup for up to 7 days, pause a losing market for 3 days.

`council/engine.mjs` is generated from the market-structure page's engine; regenerate it when the page's setup rules change.

## Scorecard

The Council page groups closed paper trades by setup and by market. A verdict needs at least 5 trades: "trust" averages more than +0.2R a trade, "avoid" loses more than 0.2R.

## Self-evolution

Every trade records its conditions at the signal (`feat`: D1 with/against, main/internal structure, session).
Once a setup has 8+ closed trades, the daily Coach adds a rule when one condition loses (≤ −0.2R over 5+) while another wins
(e.g. "swing: only with D1"), stored in `config.json` → `filters`. Setups a rule blocks are still followed as **shadow** trades
(`shadow: true`, `blockedBy`), never scored; if they make more than +0.2R over 5+, the rule is dropped. Every rule is re-tested after 21 days,
and a paused setup resumes early if its shadow trades recover.

## Guide for the AI Coach (read before every review)

**Trade fields** in `trades.json`:
- `status`: pending | open | win | loss | `be` (break-even, 0R) | missed | expired
- `R`: the result in risk units. `k`: the setup key. `market`: the market.
- `feat`: the conditions at the signal (`d1` with/against, `struct` main/internal, `session` asia/london/overlap/newyork/late).
- `mfe` / `mae`: how far the trade went for and against, in R.
- `shadow: true` + `blockedBy`: the trade was blocked by a rule and is followed but never scored. The reasons are paused, market, minRR, d1, struct, session and exposure.

**Rules** in `config.json`: `buf`, `minRisk`, `minRR`, `be`, `paused` (setups), `pausedMarkets`, `filters` (learned rules per setup, with `since` dates), and `history`. The statistical coach in `trader.mjs` applies the mechanical rules daily. Your job is judgement on top of that.

**Add to every daily review:** a "Did the rules help?" section. For each blocking reason, compare scored trades with shadow trades, and say which rules kept the council out of losers and which blocked winners.

**You may change** (at most 2 changes a day, only with 5+ closed trades behind each):
- `buf` 0.10–0.25 (±0.02)
- `minRisk` 0.4–1.2 (±0.1)
- `minRR` 1.2–2.5 (±0.1)
- `be`: null or 1
- pause a setup for at most 7 days, or a market for at most 3 days, or resume either early
- add or remove `filters[k]` entries (`d1`, `struct`, `noSession`), setting `since`

Log every change in `history` with `"by": "coach-ai"` and a `why`. Never edit `trades.json`, `state.json` or `snapshot.json`.
